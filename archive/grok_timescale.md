I have a windows pc at home working 24/7 never shuts down, I need to run two services on it, one is Timescale db and Redis, and also I need them to be available in the network environment from the other computers as well

To set up your Windows PC to run TimescaleDB and Redis 24/7 and make them accessible over your local network, you'll need to install, configure, and ensure they run as services. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieve this:
Step 1: Install TimescaleDB
TimescaleDB is a time-series database built on PostgreSQL, so you'll need to install PostgreSQL first and then add TimescaleDB.
Install PostgreSQL:
Download the PostgreSQL installer for Windows from the official website.

Run the installer, selecting your preferred version (e.g., PostgreSQL 16). During installation:
Set a password for the postgres superuser.

Note the installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16).

Let it install the default components, including pgAdmin (optional for management).

Add TimescaleDB:
Download the TimescaleDB Windows installer from the TimescaleDB GitHub releases or their official site.

Run the installer and follow the prompts to integrate it with your PostgreSQL instance.

After installation, open a command prompt and connect to PostgreSQL:

psql -U postgres

Enter your password, then enable TimescaleDB on your database:
sql

CREATE DATABASE mydb;
\c mydb
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;

Run PostgreSQL (and TimescaleDB) as a Service:
By default, PostgreSQL installs as a Windows service named something like postgresql-x64-16.

To verify it’s running:
Open services.msc (press Win + R, type services.msc, and hit Enter).

Look for postgresql-x64-16, ensure it’s set to "Automatic" startup, and is running.

If it’s not running, start it manually or troubleshoot the logs in C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\data\log.

Step 2: Install Redis
Redis doesn’t have an official Windows version, but you can use the Microsoft fork or run it via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). For simplicity, let’s use the Microsoft fork.
Download Redis for Windows:
Get the latest release from the Microsoft Archive Redis GitHub (e.g., Redis-x64-3.2.100.zip).

Extract it to a folder, e.g., C:\Redis.

Run Redis as a Service:
Open a Command Prompt in the C:\Redis folder as Administrator.

Install Redis as a Windows service:

redis-server.exe --service-install

Start the service:

redis-server.exe --service-start

Verify it’s running in services.msc (look for "Redis"). Set it to "Automatic" startup.

Test Redis:
Open another Command Prompt and run:

redis-cli.exe

Type PING. If it responds with PONG, Redis is working.

Step 3: Configure Network Access
To make TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL) and Redis accessible from other computers on your network:
Configure PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB:
Edit postgresql.conf (e.g., C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\data\postgresql.conf):
Find the line #listen_addresses = 'localhost' and change it to:

listen_addresses = '*'

Edit pg_hba.conf (same directory):
Add a line to allow network access (replace 192.168.1.0/24 with your network subnet):

host    all    all    192.168.1.0/24    md5

Restart the PostgreSQL service:
In services.msc, right-click postgresql-x64-16 and select "Restart".

Configure Redis:
Edit redis.windows.conf (in C:\Redis):
Find # bind 127.0.0.1 and change it to:

bind 0.0.0.0

Optionally set a password by uncommenting and editing:

requirepass yourpassword

Stop and restart the Redis service:

redis-server.exe --service-stop
redis-server.exe --service-start

Windows Firewall:
Open firewall.cpl (press Win + R, type firewall.cpl).

Create inbound rules to allow:
Port 5432 (PostgreSQL default) for TimescaleDB.

Port 6379 (Redis default).

Set the scope to your local network (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

Step 4: Verify Accessibility
From another PC on the network:
For TimescaleDB: Use psql or a tool like pgAdmin:

psql -h <your-pc-ip> -U postgres -d mydb

For Redis: Use redis-cli:

redis-cli -h <your-pc-ip>

Replace <your-pc-ip> with your Windows PC’s local IP (find it with ipconfig in Command Prompt).

Step 5: Keep It Running 24/7
Ensure your PC’s power settings (powercfg.cpl) are set to "High Performance" and disable sleep/hibernation.

Monitor logs if issues arise:
PostgreSQL: C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\data\log.

Redis: Check the console output or enable logging in redis.windows.conf.

Let me know if you run into issues or need help with specific configurations!

How do I add psql command to my cmd?

To use the psql command directly in your Windows Command Prompt (CMD), you need to add the PostgreSQL bin directory (where psql.exe is located) to your system's PATH environment variable. Here's how to do it step-by-step:
Step 1: Locate the PostgreSQL bin Directory
By default, if you installed PostgreSQL on Windows, the bin directory is typically located at:

C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin

For example, if you installed PostgreSQL 16, it would be:

C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin

Verify this by navigating to that folder in File Explorer. You should see psql.exe there.

Step 2: Add the Directory to the PATH
You can add it temporarily (for the current CMD session) or permanently (for all sessions).
Option 1: Temporary (Current CMD Session)
Open Command Prompt (cmd).

Run this command, replacing <version> with your PostgreSQL version:

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin

Example for version 16:

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin

Test it by typing:

psql --version

If it works, you’ll see the version (e.g., psql (PostgreSQL) 16.2).

Note: This change only lasts for the current CMD session. If you close CMD, you’ll need to repeat this.

Option 2: Permanent (System-Wide)
Open Environment Variables Settings:
Press Win + R, type sysdm.cpl, and press Enter.

Go to the "Advanced" tab and click "Environment Variables".

Edit the PATH Variable:
In the "System variables" section (or "User variables" if you want it only for your account), find and select the Path variable, then click "Edit…".

Click "New" and paste the bin directory path:

C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin

Example:

C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin

Click "OK" to close each dialog.

Apply Changes:
Click "OK" in the Environment Variables window, then "OK" in the System Properties window.

Restart CMD:
Close any open Command Prompt windows and open a new one.

Test it by typing:

psql --version

If it works, you’ll see the version output.

Step 3: Troubleshooting
Command Not Found: Double-check the path you added matches the actual location of psql.exe. If you installed PostgreSQL in a custom directory, use that instead.

Access Denied: If psql runs but prompts for a password or fails to connect, ensure your PostgreSQL service is running (services.msc) and your credentials are correct. You might need to specify the user with:

psql -U postgres

Still Not Working: Run echo %PATH% in CMD to verify the directory was added correctly.

Once this is set up, you can use psql from any Command Prompt window without needing to navigate to the bin folder manually. Let me know if you hit any snags!

even though I added the folder to the env variables on system, but the echo did not sho it

If you added the PostgreSQL bin folder to the system environment variables but echo %PATH% doesn’t show it, there might be a few reasons for this. Let’s troubleshoot and fix it step-by-step:
Step 1: Verify the Edit Was Saved Correctly
Reopen Environment Variables:
Press Win + R, type sysdm.cpl, and press Enter.

Go to the "Advanced" tab, click "Environment Variables".

In the "System variables" section, find Path, select it, and click "Edit…".

Check if C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin (e.g., C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin) is listed there.

If it’s missing, add it again by clicking "New", pasting the path, and clicking "OK" on all dialogs.

Check for Typos:
Ensure the path is correct and matches the actual location of psql.exe. For example, if PostgreSQL is installed in C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16, the bin folder should be C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin.

Avoid extra spaces or incorrect slashes (use \, not /).

Step 2: Restart Command Prompt
Changes to environment variables don’t apply to already-open Command Prompt windows. After saving the changes:
Close all open CMD windows.

Open a new Command Prompt (Win + R, type cmd, press Enter`).

Run:

echo %PATH%

Look for your PostgreSQL bin path in the output.

Step 3: Restart Windows (If Needed)
Sometimes, Windows doesn’t fully propagate system environment variable changes until a reboot:
Save any open work, then restart your PC.

After rebooting, open CMD and run echo %PATH% again.

Step 4: Check User vs. System Variables
If you added the path to "User variables" instead of "System variables" (or vice versa), it might not behave as expected:
In the "Environment Variables" window, check both sections:
User variables (Path for your account only).

System variables (Path for all users).

If you added it to "User variables" but expected it in the system PATH, the system PATH won’t include it unless merged. To fix:
Move the entry to "System variables" if you want it system-wide.

Or ensure you’re checking the full PATH (User + System) by running:

echo %PATH%

This should combine both.

Step 5: Manually Test the PATH
To confirm CMD can find psql despite echo %PATH% not showing it:
In a new CMD window, type:

psql --version

If it works, the PATH is updated correctly, and the echo output might just be truncated (the PATH can get long, and CMD sometimes cuts it off).

If it doesn’t work, manually set it in the current session to verify the path:

set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin
psql --version

If this works, the issue is definitely with the permanent PATH setting.

Step 6: Advanced Fix (Registry Check)
If the above steps fail, the environment variable might not have saved due to permissions or corruption:
Check the Registry:
Press Win + R, type regedit, and press Enter.

Navigate to:
For System PATH: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment

For User PATH: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment

Find the Path key, double-click it, and ensure your PostgreSQL bin path is listed (separated by semicolons, e.g., ;C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin).

If it’s missing, add it manually, then close Registry Editor and reboot.

Permissions:
If you can’t save changes, ensure you’re running sysdm.cpl as Administrator (right-click the Start menu, choose "System", then "Advanced system settings").

Step 7: Final Verification
After fixing, open a new CMD and run:

echo %PATH%

If it’s still not showing but psql --version works, don’t worry—the PATH is likely too long to display fully, but it’s functional.

If it’s still broken, let me know what you see in the "Environment Variables" window or echo %PATH%, and I’ll dig deeper!

Let me know how it goes or if you need more help!

This msg is from the remote server:
$ redis-cli -h 192.168.1.8 ping
Could not connect to Redis at 192.168.1.8:6379: Unknown error

The error message Could not connect to Redis at 192.168.1.8:6379: Unknown error from redis-cli indicates that your remote server (the client) cannot reach the Redis instance running on your Windows PC at IP 192.168.1.8. This could be due to network configuration, Redis settings, or firewall issues. Let’s troubleshoot and resolve it step-by-step.
Step 1: Verify Redis is Running on the Host
Check Redis Service:
On your Windows PC (IP 192.168.1.8), open services.msc (press Win + R, type services.msc, and hit Enter).

Look for the "Redis" service (e.g., "Redis" or something similar if you installed it as a service).

Ensure it’s running. If not, right-click and select "Start".

Test Locally:
On the Windows PC, open Command Prompt and run:

redis-cli ping

If it responds with PONG, Redis is running locally. If not, there’s an issue with the Redis server itself (e.g., it crashed or didn’t start).

Step 2: Check Redis Network Configuration
Redis might not be listening on the correct network interface or port.
Verify Bind Address:
Open the Redis configuration file (redis.windows.conf in your Redis installation folder, e.g., C:\Redis).

Find the bind directive. It should be set to:

bind 0.0.0.0

0.0.0.0 means Redis listens on all network interfaces (including 192.168.1.8). If it’s still bind 127.0.0.1, it’s only accessible locally, not over the network.

If you changed this, stop and restart Redis:

redis-server.exe --service-stop
redis-server.exe --service-start

Check Port:
Ensure the port setting in redis.windows.conf is 6379 (the default):

port 6379

If it’s different, note the new port and use it in your redis-cli command (e.g., redis-cli -h 192.168.1.8 -p <port>).

Step 3: Verify Network Connectivity
The remote server might not be able to reach 192.168.1.8.
Ping the Host:
From the remote server, run:

ping 192.168.1.8

If you get replies, the network is reachable. If it times out, there’s a network issue (e.g., different subnets, router blocking).

Check Port Availability:
On the Windows PC, open Command Prompt and run:

netstat -an | find "6379"

Look for output like:

TCP    0.0.0.0:6379    0.0.0.0:0    LISTENING

If you see this, Redis is listening on port 6379 on all interfaces.

If it’s missing or shows 127.0.0.1:6379, Redis isn’t bound correctly (recheck Step 2).

Step 4: Check Windows Firewall
The Windows Firewall might be blocking incoming connections to port 6379.
Open Firewall Settings:
Press Win + R, type firewall.cpl, and press Enter.

Click "Advanced settings" on the left.

Check Inbound Rules:
In "Inbound Rules", look for a rule allowing port 6379 (you might have created this earlier).

If it’s missing, create one:
Click "New Rule" on the right.

Select "Port" > "TCP" > Specific local ports: 6379.

Allow the connection.

Apply to your network type (e.g., Private or All).

Name it (e.g., "Redis 6379") and finish.

Test Again:
From the remote server, retry:

redis-cli -h 192.168.1.8 ping

Step 5: Additional Checks
If it’s still failing:
Antivirus or Security Software:
Some antivirus programs block ports. Temporarily disable any third-party security software on the Windows PC and test again.

Redis Logs:
Check Redis logs (if logging is enabled in redis.windows.conf) or run Redis manually in the foreground to see errors:

redis-server.exe redis.windows.conf

Correct IP:
Confirm 192.168.1.8 is the Windows PC’s IP:
On the Windows PC, run ipconfig in CMD and check the "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter.

Authentication:
If you set a password in redis.windows.conf (requirepass), include it in the command:

redis-cli -h 192.168.1.8 -a yourpassword ping

Step 6: Final Test
From the remote server:

redis-cli -h 192.168.1.8 ping

If it says PONG, you’re good!

If not, let me know the exact error or behavior, and I’ll refine the troubleshooting (e.g., share netstat output or firewall rules).

What do you see when you try these steps?

I've done all that, the remote replies PONG locally, but remotely it cannot be reached

If Redis responds with PONG when you test it locally on the Windows PC (e.g., redis-cli ping), but the remote server still can’t connect (redis-cli -h 192.168.1.8 ping fails), the issue is likely between the Windows PC and the remote server—most likely a network or firewall problem. Since you’ve already configured Redis to bind to 0.0.0.0 and set up a firewall rule, let’s narrow it down further.
Step 1: Confirm Local Listening
On the Windows PC, run:

netstat -an | find "6379"

Expected output should include:

TCP    0.0.0.0:6379    0.0.0.0:0    LISTENING

If it shows 127.0.0.1:6379 instead, Redis is still only listening locally. Reopen redis.windows.conf, ensure bind 0.0.0.0 is set, and restart the service:

redis-server.exe --service-stop
redis-server.exe --service-start

If it’s correct (0.0.0.0:6379), move on.

Step 2: Test Network Reachability
The remote server needs to reach 192.168.1.8 on port 6379.
Ping Test:
From the remote server, run:

ping 192.168.1.8

If it replies, basic network connectivity is fine. If it times out:
Check if both machines are on the same subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.x).

Ensure no router or network policy blocks traffic between them.

Port Test:
Use a tool like telnet or nc (Netcat) from the remote server to test port 6379:
On Windows remote server: Install Telnet (dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient) and run:

telnet 192.168.1.8 6379

On Linux remote server: Run:

nc -zv 192.168.1.8 6379

Success: You’ll get a connection (Telnet shows a blank screen, nc says "succeeded").

Failure: "Connection refused" or timeout means something is blocking port 6379.

Step 3: Re-Check Windows Firewall
Even with a rule, the firewall might still block traffic due to misconfiguration.
Verify the Rule:
Open firewall.cpl > "Advanced settings" > "Inbound Rules".

Find your Redis rule (e.g., "Redis 6379").

Ensure:
Protocol: TCP

Local Port: 6379

Action: Allow

Scope: "Any IP" or your subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)

Applies to your network profile (Private/Public, depending on your network).

Temporarily Disable Firewall:
For testing, disable the firewall entirely:
firewall.cpl > "Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off" > Turn off for Private/Public networks.

Retry from the remote server:

redis-cli -h 192.168.1.8 ping

If it works, the firewall rule needs adjustment. Re-enable the firewall and fix the rule.

Step 4: Check Network Configuration
If the firewall isn’t the issue, it could be the Windows PC’s network setup.
Confirm IP Address:
On the Windows PC, run:

ipconfig

Check the "IPv4 Address" under your active adapter (e.g., Ethernet or Wi-Fi). Confirm it’s 192.168.1.8. If it’s changed (e.g., DHCP assigned a new IP), update the remote command accordingly.

Multiple Network Interfaces:
If the PC has multiple adapters (e.g., Wi-Fi and Ethernet), Redis might bind to the wrong one. Run:

netstat -an | find "6379"

If it shows a specific IP (not 0.0.0.0), explicitly set bind 192.168.1.8 in redis.windows.conf and restart Redis.

Step 5: Test with a Different Client
Try connecting from another machine on the same network (e.g., another PC or a phone with a Redis client app) to rule out an issue with the remote server itself:

redis-cli -h 192.168.1.8 ping

If another client works, the problem is on the original remote server (e.g., its outbound firewall or network config).

Step 6: Gather More Info
If it’s still failing, please provide:
Output of netstat -an | find "6379" from the Windows PC.

Exact error from the remote server (e.g., "Unknown error" or something else if it changed).

Result of ping 192.168.1.8 and telnet 192.168.1.8 6379 (or nc -zv) from the remote server.

Whether disabling the firewall helped.

With this, I can pinpoint the exact blocker. What do you see when you try the above?
