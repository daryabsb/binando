ðŸ“Š Example Strategy
Capital: $100
Symbol: BTC/USDT
Grid Size: 5 buy levels
Buy Levels: Every 1% drop from the current price
Sell Targets: 1.5% above each buy level


ðŸ“‰ Example Grid Setup (Assume BTC = $30,000)
Buy Order	    Buy Price	    Sell Price	    Profit (after 0.1% fee)
1st Order	    $30,000	        $30,450	        âœ… 1.4%
2nd Order	    $29,700	        $30,150	        âœ… 1.4%
3rd Order	    $29,400	        $29,841	        âœ… 1.4%
4th Order	    $29,100	        $29,537	        âœ… 1.4%
5th Order	    $28,800	        $29,232	        âœ… 1.4%


ðŸ›‘ Risk Management
âœ” Don't trade in a downtrendâ€”only start when the market is recovering.
âœ” Use stop-loss if BTC drops more than 5% below the lowest buy order.
âœ” Never use all capital in one tradeâ€”split into multiple small buys.

ðŸš€ Why This Strategy Works for Small Capital
âœ… No need for big fundsâ€”trades small portions at a time.
âœ… Avoids trading in loopsâ€”ensures 1.5% profit before selling.
âœ… Scalabilityâ€”start small, increase trade size as profits grow.
âœ… Works in any market conditionâ€”adjust grid levels dynamically.


ðŸ“¢ Want Even More Profit?
If you want higher accuracy, you can add:
ðŸ“Œ RSI (Relative Strength Index) to buy at oversold levels.
ðŸ“Œ MACD to confirm trend before buying.
ðŸ“Œ Volume Analysis to avoid weak breakouts.

ðŸ“Œ RSI (Relative Strength Index) â€“ To buy only when the asset is oversold (<30).
ðŸ“Œ MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) â€“ To confirm trend direction before trading.
ðŸ“Œ Volume Analysis â€“ To avoid false breakouts (low volume = weak movement).
